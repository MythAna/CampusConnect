CampusConnect - Building Meaningful College Connections

The Challenge:
In today's school and college environment, many students struggle to form genuine connections. Between packed class schedules and the pressure to perform academically, opportunities to meet like-minded peers are often limited. Traditional social platforms aren't designed to facilitate the kinds of friendships that make school and college rewarding.

My Solution:
CampusConnect is a specialized platform designed exclusively for college students to discover meaningful friendships. By focusing on shared academic interests, extracurricular activities and personal values, we help students cut through the noise of generic social networks.

How It Works:
Students create verified profiles using their university credentials. The profile setup emphasizes academic interests, club affiliations and personal hobbies rather than just appearance. My matching algorithm then suggests potential friends based on overlapping classes, complementary interests and shared campus activities. When two students express mutual interest, they're connected through the messaging system with suggested conversation starters based on their shared profile elements.

Key Features:
The profile system captures academic details like major and coursework alongside extracurricular interests. My matching algorithm gives priority to connections that have multiple points of alignment. The messaging system includes built-in icebreakers based on shared profile information to help start conversations naturally.

Technical Implementation:
Built on .NET Core with JWT authentication, the platform uses Entity Framework Core for data management. The matching system employs a weighted algorithm that considers both academic and personal interests. Real-time features like chat notifications are handled through SignalR. Developed initially through Udemy coursework, the project has evolved into a functional system - with only minor UI refinements remaining before full deployment. The codebase demonstrates professional-grade architecture, clean separation of concerns and comprehensive error handling.

Getting Started:
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure the database connection in appsettings.json
3. Run the API using 'dotnet run'
4. Launch the frontend application

Impact and Vision:
CampusConnect represents a new approach to student socialization - one that values quality connections over quantity. By focusing on the unique aspects of college and school life and the natural connections that exist within academic communities, we're helping students build the kinds of relationships that define the school and college experience.
