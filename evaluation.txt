CampusConnect is a nearly completed web application designed to help college and school students form meaningful, academically aligned social connections. 
At the current stage, all core backend systems—including secure login, user profiling and intelligent matching—are fully implemented and tested. 
Real-time communication using SignalR is functioning reliably in development environments and the majority of UI components are operational.

The current version accurately demonstrates the core goals: connecting students through academic and personal factors using a weighted matching algorithm, real-time chat. 
Output is consistent and relevant to the project’s intent, especially across the verified profile and matching system.

Remaining Work:
Minor UI refinements (styling, layout consistency)
Expanded test coverage
Deployment pipeline configuration
These remaining tasks, while important for production readiness, do not affect the accuracy or functionality of the core logic and features that have already been built.

Reflection:
The project began as a learning exercise based on Udemy coursework and GWC concepts. 
However, it evolved significantly beyond that scope, with custom architectural decisions, clean code practices and implementation of real-world features.
While not yet fully deployed, the system functions end-to-end with realistic data and simulated usage. Completing the remaining UI and testing work will bring it to full readiness.
